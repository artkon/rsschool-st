## Deque
Implement data structure **deque** using test first approach. It should be done as a **stand-alone**, **clean**, **independent component**, which can be used wherever needed. Deque should have the following methods (you can add your own methods, but 4 listed below must be and named exactly as stated):

```js
const deque = new Deque();

/**
  WARNING:
  Please use the suggested functions names!
**/

// receive infinite number of items and place one by one to deque
// left - boolean param:
// true - push to left end;
// false - push to right end;
deque.push(left, ...args);

// return array contains n items of deque (removes those from structure)
// left - boolean param:
// true - pop from left end;
// false - pop from right end;
deque.pop(n, left);

// returns top item of deque (do not remove returned item from structure)
// left - boolean param:
// true - top from left end;
// false - top from right end;
deque.top(left);

// merges 2 deques in one and returns new deque,
// left - boolean param:
// true - place received deque to the left end;
// false - place received deque to the right end;
deque.merge(dequeB, left);
```

##### Unit tests must cover as much sceanrios as possible: possitive and negative as well.
