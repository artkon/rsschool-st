## Stack
Implement data structure **stack** using test first approach. It should be done as a **stand-alone**, **clean**, **independent component**, which can be used wherever needed. Stack should have the following methods (you can add your own methods, but 4 listed below must be and named exactly as stated):

```js
const stack = new Stack(size); // size - MAX number of items in stack;

/**
  WARNING:
  Please use the suggested functions names!
**/

// receive infinite number of items and place one by one to stack
stack.push(...args);

// return array contains n items of stack (removes those from structure)
stack.pop(n);

// returns top item of stack (do not remove returned item from structure)
stack.top();

// merges 2 stacks in one and returns new stack,
// first - boolean param:
// - true - place received stack first;
// - false - place original first;
stack.merge(stackB, first);
```

##### Unit tests must cover as much sceanrios as possible: possitive and negative as well.
