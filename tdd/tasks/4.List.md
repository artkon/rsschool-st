## List
Implement data structure **list** using test first approach. It should be done as a **stand-alone**, **clean**, **independent component**, which can be used wherever needed. List should have the following methods (you can add your own methods, but 4 listed below must be and named exactly as stated). :

```js
const list = new List();

/**
  WARNING:
  Please use the suggested functions names!
**/

// stores specified value to the list;
list.add(value);

// returns element by specified index;
list.getAt(index);

// removes item stored under specified index;
list.removeAt(index);

// returns index of specified value;
list.indexOf(value);
```

##### Unit tests must cover as much sceanrios as possible: possitive and negative as well.
