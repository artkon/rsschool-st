## Tree
Implement data structure **tree** using test first approach. It should be done as a **stand-alone**, **clean**, **independent component**, which can be used wherever needed. Tree should have the following methods (you can add your own methods, but 4 listed below must be and named exactly as stated). :

```js
const tree = new Tree();

/**
  WARNING:
  Please use the suggested functions names!
**/

// stores specified value in tree using key;
tree.insert(key, value);

// removes node from tree by provided key;
tree.delete(key);

// looking for stored data in tree using key;
tree.search(key);

// returns whether tree contains such value or not;
tree.contains(value);
```

##### Unit tests must cover as much sceanrios as possible: possitive and negative as well.
