## Queue
Implement data structure **queue** using test first approach. It should be done as a **stand-alone**, **clean**, **independent component**, which can be used wherever needed. Queue should have the following methods (you can add your own methods, but 4 listed below must be and named exactly as stated):

```js
const queue = new Queue(size); // size - MAX number of items in queue;

/**
  WARNING:
  Please use the suggested functions names!
**/

// receive infinite number of items and place one by one to queue
queue.push(...args);

// return array contains n items of queue (removes those from structure)
queue.pop(n);

// returns top item of queue (do not remove returned item from structure)
queue.top();

// merges 2 queues in one and returns new queue,
// first - boolean param:
// - true - place received queue first;
// - false - place original first;
queue.merge(queueB, first);
```

##### Unit tests must cover as much sceanrios as possible: possitive and negative as well.
